== Overview
This API is used to create, edit and manage Klass Subsets, depending on configuration you may have to be signed in/authorized to perform some operations.

=== Supported formats and character sets
in order to keep the maintenance low we have limited this api to only accept  Json and UTF-8, this may change in the future.

==== Supported formats
`application/json`

==== Supported character sets
`UTF-8`

=== HTTP status codes
Klass Subsets API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `202 ACCEPTED`
| The request operation completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed, i.e. the client has used a not valid request. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist. The response body will include an error providing further information
|===

=== Errors
Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain an error message
that describes the problem. For example, a request for a non-existent Subset.

include::{managementSnippets}/error-example/http-request.adoc[]

will produce a `404 Not Found` response:

include::{managementSnippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]
